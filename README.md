## Course description

This course is an economics-focused survey of modern computational modeling methods that are valuable to empirical, computational, and numerical research. The course begins with some basics of numerical derivatives and integrals. We then spend two days on dynamic programming, which is a very general and flexible way to pose a dynamic problem and which has powerful iterative global solution techniques. We then transition into a week-and-a-half of structural estimation methods. These methods generalize many of the specific estimation techniques that come after. Finally, we spend the last half of the course with a survey of some of the most common statistical learning/machine learning methods.

## Grades

You will have 8 problem sets throughout the term. I will drop everybody's lowest problem set score. For this reason, problem sets will only account for 80 percent of your grade.

| Assignment       | Quantity | Points | Total Points | Percent |
|------------------|----------|--------|--------------|---------|
| Problem Sets     | 8        | 10     | 70           | 77.8%     |
| Midterm exam     | 1        | 20     | 20           | 22.2%     |
| **Total Points** | --       | --     | 90           | 100%    |

Late problem sets will be penalized 2 points for every hour they are late. For example, if an assignment is due on Monday at 11:30am, the following points will be deducted based on the time stamp of the last commit.

| Example PR last commit | points deducted |
| ---------------------- | --------------- |
| 11:31am to 12:30pm     | -2 points       |
| 12:31pm to 1:30pm      | -4 points       |
| 1:31pm to 2:30pm       | -6 points       |
| 2:31pm to 3:30pm       | -8 points       |
| 3:30pm and beyond      | -10 points (no credit) |

## Assignment submission procedure

This folder on your fork of the class repository `github.com/YourGitHubHandle/persp-model-econ_W19/ProblemSets/` is where you will submit your problem sets and project assignments. You will just commit and push your assignments to the appropriate folder. For example, your files for PS1 should be committed to the PS1 folder on your fork of the class repository.

`/persp-model-econ_W19/ProblemSets/PS1/YourFile.pdf`

I will use a shell script to clone all class members' repositories at the time the assignments are due.

## Disability services

If you need any special accommodations, please provide us with a copy of your Accommodation Determination Letter (provided to you by the Student Disability Services office) as soon as possible so that you may discuss with me how your accommodations may be implemented in this course.
